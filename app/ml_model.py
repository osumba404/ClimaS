# Current: Predict temp, rainfall, humidity, and simulate "deforestation factor"

# We Can Add:
# Predict extreme weather likelihood (heatwaves, drought probability)
# Feature importance graph (what's driving the climate most?)
# Trend uncertainty ranges (best & worst-case projections)
# Regional comparison (compare two regions side by side)
# Save user simulation scenarios
